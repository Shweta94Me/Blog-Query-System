I have taken a reference from provided prj1-sol solution.

Files:
blog544.js This skeleton file constitutes the guts of the project. 
index.js This file provides the complete command-line behavior which is required by the program. It requires blog544.js. 
meta.js Meta-information about the different blog object categories. 
blog-error.js A trival class for application errors.
validator.js Validation code from the previous project. It provides generic validation based on types for input parameters. More validation will be necessary, especially for validation across objects.

MongoDB:
Used MongoDB to provide basic CRUD operations.
All asynchronous mongo library functions can be called directly using await.
Mongo db indexes are used to facilitate search.
